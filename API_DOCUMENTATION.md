## Frontend Integration

### API Client Setup

The frontend uses these endpoints through a Redux store with RTK Query. Here's how the RBAC permissions map to API access:

```typescript
// Role-based API access in frontend
const useAuth = () => {
  // Permission functions that determine API access
  const canManageShops = () => user?.role === 'owner';
  const canViewFinancialData = () => user?.role === 'owner';  
  const canManageInventory = () => ['owner', 'employee'].includes(user?.role);
  const canManageEmployees = () => user?.role === 'owner';
};
```

### Frontend Permission Guards

Components are protected with permission guards that correspond to backend access:

```typescript
// Examples of frontend guards matching backend permissions
<PermissionGuard permission="canManageShops">
  {/* Calls /api/shop/shops/ - Owner only */}
</PermissionGuard>

<PermissionGuard permission="canViewFinancialData">
  {/* Calls /api/shop/repair-orders/financial_summary/ - Owner only */}
</PermissionGuard>

<PermissionGuard permission="canManageInventory">
  {/* Calls /api/shop/services/, /api/shop/parts/ - Owner + Employee */}
</PermissionGuard>
```

## Testing the API

### Using curl
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "owner@autorepairshop.com", "password": "owner123"}'

# Use token
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/shop/shops/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
```

### Using Python requests
```python
import requests

# Login
response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/', 
                        json={'email': 'owner@autorepairshop.com', 'password': 'owner123'})
tokens = response.json()

# Make authenticated request
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {tokens["access"]}'}
shops = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/shop/shops/', headers=headers)
```

## Sample Test Accounts

```
Owner:    owner@autorepairshop.com     / owner123
Employee: john.mechanic@autorepair.com / password123
Customer: alice.cooper@customer.com    / password123
```

## Frontend Testing

Visit the RBAC test suite in your browser to verify all permissions:
